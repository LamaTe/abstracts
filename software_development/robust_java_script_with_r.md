# Robust JavaScript with R

Authors: John	Coene

# Description

R has been propelled into web browsers namely with the arrival of Shiny and Rmarkdown. This leads many R programmers to delve into using JavaScript and an increasing number of packages now leverage JavaScript (e.g.: plotly, waiter).

These however do not make use of more advanced JavaScript tools that projects of such size should use to organise the growing complexity of the JavaScript code they comprise. Instead all the JavaScript code tends to reside in a single file.

The packer project aims to remedy to that by providing a framework that enforces good practices using webpack and npm but also makes those tools work hand-in-hand with R packages and golem shiny applications.

Nothing like a short presentation and demo to illustrate the many advantages this brings to the table.
