# Using {trundler} to construct the ZAF Alcohol Index

Authors: Andrew Collier (Exegetic Analytics) Matt Dennis

# Description 

The South African government banned the sale of alcohol for three months, as part of its strategy to combat COVID-19. When the ban was finally lifted, many people had completely exhausted their alcohol supplies. We wondered if prices would rise as stores re-opened, so we built an index to track changes in alcohol prices.  

We used Trundler, a service which provides historical product pricing data from about 150 retailers through an API, to get the data. In our talk, we’ll discuss the methodology we used to build the index; demonstrate how we used {trundler} to source data from the Trundler API; and of course, we’ll also present the index itself.
