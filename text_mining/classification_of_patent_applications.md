Authors: Maciej	Chrabąszcz (Sages/SigDelta), Norbert Ryciak, Maciej Bartoszuk

# Description

The subject of the presentation will be showing the solution to the classification of patent applications, which won second place in the Govtech competition. We will discuss the specification of the problem (multilabel, long documents, amount of data, and their origin), approaches, and final solution. Especially we will talk about our method of document representation, which was based on representing a document as an “embedding cloud”. We will draw attention to how solutions that win competitions differ from real solutions applied in business.
